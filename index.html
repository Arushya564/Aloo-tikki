        <h2><p>Recipe</p></h2>
        <li>Step 1-Rinse and Peel 4-5 medium potatoes. Place a the potatoes in a bowl and the bowl in a cooker.Boil them just until cooked. You need anywhere from 3-5 whistles to cook them on medium heat and then cool them.</li><br>
        <li>Step 2-Grate or mash them with a masher</li><br>
        <li>Step 3-Ensure potatoes are completely cooled before adding the other ingredients otherwise the flour and bread crumbs will turn sticky.</li><br>
        <li>Step 4-Next you have to add:
            <dl>2 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves</dl>
            <dl>½ teaspoon ginger(paste or grated)</dl>
            <dl>1 chopped green chilli</dl>
            <dl>¾ teaspoon garam masala</dl>
            <dl>½ teaspoon chaat masala</dl>
        </li><br>
        <li>Step 5-Add ¾ teaspoon salt and ½ to ¾ teaspoon red chilli powder.</li><br>
        <li>Step 6-Add 2 tablespoons rice flour or corn flour and 4 tablespoons bread crumbs.</li><br>
        <li>Step 7-Bind the mixture together to make a ball. Add more bread crumbs if the mixture turns sticky. Ensure the mixture is non-sticky. Sticky or soggy mixture will make soft aloo tikkis. Taste this and add more salt or spice if needed.</li><br>
        <li>Step 8-Divide the mixture to equal sized balls. You can make big ones to make large tikkis. But thin tikkis turn out crispy and tasty.</li><br>
        <li>Step 9-Flatten them and stick up the cracked edges.</li><br>
        <li>Step 10-Heat oil in a cast iron or non-sticky pan. You can fry them or shallow fry them. I prefer to shallow fry them to make the aloo tikkis extra crisp.Do the heat test by dropping a small piece of the mixture to the hot oil. If the oil is hot enough the mixture will rise up without browning a lot.</li><br>
        <li>Step 11-Then gently slide them one after the other. Fry on a medium heat in hot oil. Do not disturb them until the base turns firm and golden. Flip them and fry on both the sides until golden and crisp. Remove them to a kitchen tissue.</li>
        <p>Now serve the aloo tikki hot with green chutney or serve as a patty in a burger.</p>
